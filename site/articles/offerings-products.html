	We, at <a href="https://www.32crayons.com">32Crayons</a>, have started off our journey providing consulting services to few clients. We do have an aspiration to have build Products.

</p>
<p>
	<em>What do we mean by the word 'Products'?</em>

</p>
<p>
A bit of ground work needs to be done before tackling that question. Let us first consider something called an 'Offering'
</p>
<p>
	<table>
		<tr><td>
	<b>Offering: (noun)</b></td>
	<td width="15"></td><td>
		A tangible or intangible thing of value created by an organization and provided to others for their use.
	</td></tr></table>
</p>

<p>
An offering would be could consist of many smaller pieces. These smaller pieces would be of two types: <br/>
	<ul>
		<li>S-Type</li>
		<li>P-Type</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<p>
Let us see what these types are below:

<ul>
	<li><b>S-Type:</b> S-Type pieces are the ones that are created at or very close to the time of delivering value</li>
	<li><b>P-Type</b>: P-Type pieces are the ones that are created much before actual delivery of value</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Let us consider various pieces that going into the offering provided by a McDonald’s restaurant when a customer walks in and orders:
</p>
	<ul><li>The menu where the customer chooses, let's say, a Maharaja Mac Meal
	  </li><li>The placing/mixing of ingredients as per the recipe to make burger
	  </li><li>Deep frying and shaking salt on the french fries
	  </li><li>Putting the fries and burger into a paper container
	  </li><li>Filling up a cup with Coke from the soda fountain
	  </li><li>Putting them all on a tray and serving it to the customer
	</li></ul>


<p>
 In the above scenario at McD:
</p>
<p>
  1. The taking of the order, making of the burger, frying and filling the soda cup and finally serving them all to the customer are pieces of S-Type</p>
<p>
  2. The menu, recipe, the frier, the salt shaker, the utensil to guide fries into the fries paper container, the fries paper container, the soda machine, the cup, the tray are some of pieces of P-Type.
</p>
<p>
	Point to note: A piece that falls between S-Type and P-Type is the paper container. They are made at the beginning of the day from the die-cut flattened pieces McD branded paper. The making at the beginning of the day is of Type S and the die-cut flattened pieces are of P-Type.
</p>
We call the offerings that fall into P-Type Products.
<p>
	Products are an important area of focus for Udhyam Vyapaar as 
</p>
<ul><li>they can be centrally produced and quality can be monitored and controlled
</li><li>they can be made at scale way more easily than offerings with pieces of S-Type
</li></ul>
