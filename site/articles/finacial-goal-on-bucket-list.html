<a href="mi.html">A Financial Goal in My Bucket List</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
	I recently came across the notion of a bucket list and I really liked it. While I always wanted to do a few things before I die, I never penned down a list.
</p>

<p>One item on that is a financial goal. If one looks at 43Things.com, there are few often-used financial goals and a popular financial goal is to "become a millionaire".</p>

<p>
	While it is a popular goal, does it really hold any meaning for someone. Think of it this way: is it a million because its a round figure? Or is it a million because that is what gets talked about? Does it have specific personal meaning? As a goal, it offers way less than say "run a marathon" or "ask someone out" or "back pack through europe" do.

</p>

<p>
	I would like my financial goal to mean something specfic to me. I have been thinking about being financially independent for a long time now and I have a personal financial goal. It isn't simple like "become a millionaire" but it holds tremendous appeal to me. Before I can explain what my goal is I need to describe something called a claim check:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>

Claim Check (n)
<ul>
<li>A receipt for property you have claim to.
<li>A numbered receipt or part of a ticket given to a passenger for claiming his baggage at the destination.</ul>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
And the following quote gives a good sense of how I want to use the word "claim check":
</p>


<p>
	<blockquote>

<p><em>The way I see it is that my money represents an enormous number of claim checks on society. Itâ€™s like I have these little pieces of paper that I can turn into consumption<em><p> -- <b>Warren Buffett</b>
</blockquote>

</p><p>
And my goal is to:

<blockquote>

"Collect Claim Checks Worth 50 Years of Consumption":
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>The idea is to have enough claim checks that can be converted to consumption for next fifty years. It isn't catchy like "become a millionaire" but it serves me well. By the time I reach this I probably won't have 50 years to go and I can choose to stop working if I don't feel like it and start doing things that I really want to.</p>
