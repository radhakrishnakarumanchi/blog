<dt><a href="nq.html">Leaving Udhyam Vyapaar - Naive Quitting</a>
</dt>
<dd>

<p>
	I recently left Udhyam Vyapaar. Almost a year before that, I talked to my manager about my desire to leave.
	I didn’t have a timeline in my mind; I felt that developing a successor to lead Vyapaar was a thing I ought to do before leaving.
</p><p>
	I hoped that one of the tenured team members could step into my shoes and lead Vyapaar.
	For some reason, I couldn’t progress much on that front, and the feeling that I ought to develop a successor remained strong.
	I didn’t know the source of that feeling, though.
</p><p>
	Nonetheless, I am happy that I actively contributed to the search, assessment, and onboarding of my replacement.
	The new leader is Menaka; she is an excellent fit for Vyapaar, and I was glad she and I could spend 30+ hours one-on-one while she was settling in.
</p>
<p>I have some time on my hands now and am reading a bit. I happened to re-read an article titled
	<a href="https://sive.rs/nq">‘Naive Quitting’</a>, and in doing so, I had an epiphany regarding my urge to develop a successor.
</p><p>Do read <a href="https://sive.rs/nq">Naive Quitting</a> to understand my urge; it will not take more than couple of minutes.
</p><p>
My epiphany is this: I had no conscious awareness of the naive-quitting notion and yet somehow seem to have driven by it. I do not know whether I’ve quit naively or not, but I am happy I went about it the way I did.
